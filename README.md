# soiLique
soiLique: A MATLABÂ® Based Algorithm for Deterministic Soil Liquefaction Analysis
					   
              
									Liquefaction Analysis program. 
Setup Notes:

+ The user can find the setup file in the directory:  /soiLique_setup_web_supported/for redistribution/soilique_web.exe 
+ To setup "soiLique.exe", the user will need Matlab Runtime Environment at least v9.4.
+ Matlab Runtime Environment v9.4 will be downloaded and installed from the internet automatically during the installation.
+ Please be sure that you are connected to the internet during installation procedure for the decent installation.

Using with Matlab: 

+ If the user do not want to setup soiLique, he/she will open it in MATLAB with the help of "soiLique.m" file. 
+ "soiLique.m" is the main file that opens the GUI and uses functions.
